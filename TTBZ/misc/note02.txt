* add vegas random vars to main dipole routine
   EvalDipoles_QQBTTBGG(p,sum_dip)  --> EvalDipoles_QQBTTBGG(p,yRndDK,sum_dip)
   with real(8) :: yRndDK(1:8) and store it globally but private in the module

* add weight var to main dipole routine
  EvalDipoles_QQBTTBGG(p,yRndDK,sum_dip)  --> EvalDipoles_QQBTTBGG(p,yRndDK,Wgt,sum_dip)
  Wgt will include pdfs and all other prefactors
  (here I assume that we don't want to evaluate the pdfs with a dynamic scale!)

* introduce top decay routine: (should replace call to top spinors somewhere in GenerateEventxxx)
   routines to generate decay PS:  (only if the switch "TopDecays.ge.1", "TopDecays.eq.0" means NO top decay)
      call EvalPhasespace_TopDecay(MomExt(0:3,1),yRndDK(1:4),.false.,MomDK(0:3,1:3),PSWgt2)
      call EvalPhasespace_TopDecay(MomExt(0:3,2),yRndDK(5:8),.false.,MomDK(0:3,4:6),PSWgt3)
   where MomExt(0:3,i) is the momentum array for top and antitop,
   MomDK is the momentum array for the decay particles with MomDK(0:3,1:6): 1=BotBar, 2=lep-, 3=NeuBar, 4=Bot, 5=lep+, 6=Neu
   PSWgt2/PSWgt3 are additional PS weights

  routines to generate top decay spinor:  (only if the switch "TopDecays.ge.1")
      call TopDecay(TopQuark(1),.false.,0,MomDK(0:3,1:3))
      call TopDecay(TopQuark(2),.false.,0,MomDK(0:3,4:6))
  where TopQuark(1)/TopQuark(2) are particle structures (type(Particle)) fot top and antitop, i.e. it should be something like ExtParticles(1)/ExtParticles(2)

  helicity loops need to be truncted  (only if the switch "TopDecays.ge.1")


* introduce PS cuts and binning routines
    replace "call jetktalg(q,5,pjetout,Njet,weight)"
    by      "call Kinematics(3,MomExt(0:3,1:5),MomDK(0:3,1:6),applyPSCut,NBin(1:NumHistograms))"
    the jet algorithm is sitting inside this routine, it will return if the event passes the PS cuts (via applyPSCut) AND
    it returns an array of integer numbers into which bin the event falls for each histogram
    my conventions for the momentum arrays in "Kinematics" are usually:
         MomExt(0:3,1:4): 1=In_left, 2=In_right, 3=TopBar, 4=Top
         MomDK(0:3,1:6) : 1=BotBar, 2=lep-, 3=NeuBar, 4=Bot, 5=lep+, 6=Neu
    with 2-->3/6 kinematics.
    If this is convention is inconvenient we can change it! I have not yet implemented anything inside of "Kinematics".


    if the event passes the cuts the dipole result needs to be thrown into the histogram at the very end of the routine:
      do NHisto=1,NumHistograms
          call intoHisto(NHisto,NBin(NHisto),DipoleResult)
      enddo

    remember that "Wgt", all PSWgts and a minus sign need to be multiplied first,
    I will take care of what needs to be added in the routines "Kinematics" and "intoHisto".



* in some modules a "first_time" if-condition needs to be introduced around the "InitTrees","InitProcess_xxx" and "LinkTreeParticles" routines
  also the variables "ExtParticles" and "TreeAmpsDip" have to be declared with a "save" statement
  see mod_Dipoles_QQBTTBGG.f90 for example
